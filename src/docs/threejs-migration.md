- [x] Update camera settings
- [x] Update lighting setup

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test basic scene rendering
- [ ] Test animations
- [ ] Test materials and shaders
- [ ] Test physics
- [ ] Test post-processing effects
- [ ] Test performance
- [ ] Test on different devices

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize render calls
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Optimize shader code
- [ ] Review and optimize asset loading
- [ ] Check for any memory leaks

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation with new Three.js version
- [ ] Document any breaking changes
- [ ] Update setup instructions
- [ ] Document any new features used

## Breaking Changes to Watch For
1. Material system changes
2. Geometry system updates
3. Shader syntax changes
4. Camera API changes
5. Animation system updates
6. Physics system updates

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Cross-browser testing
5. Mobile device testing

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep backup of working version
2. Document all changes made
3. Create rollback scripts
4. Test rollback procedure

## Success Criteria
1. All components render correctly
2. All animations work smoothly
3. No console errors
4. Performance meets or exceeds current version
5. All features work as expected
6. No memory leaks
7. Cross-browser compatibility maintained

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: ✅ Completed
2. Phase 2: ✅ Completed
3. Phase 3: ✅ Completed
4. Phase 4: In Progress
5. Phase 5: Pending
6. Phase 6: Pending

## Notes
- Take incremental steps
- Test after each major change
- Document all issues and solutions
- Keep track of performance metrics
- Regular commits with clear messages

## Current Status
- All code, custom geometry, and shaders have been reviewed and are compatible with Three.js v175.
- Ready to begin comprehensive testing (Phase 4). 

## New Import
```js
import { Stats } from '@react-three/drei';
``` 

## New Canvas Component
```jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { Stats } from '@react-three/drei';

const SceneCanvas = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      {/* ...your scene... */}
      <Stats />
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default SceneCanvas;
```
